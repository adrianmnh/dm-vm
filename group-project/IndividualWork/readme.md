`Agencies impacted by the modernization of our organization are as follows`

The original structure of eMovies fit our organization's movie rental business model in the past. However, after modernization, physical movie rentals are no longer part of the business. We have chosen to follow a more modern approach by creating a subscription based model for our customers to stream movies to their devices, providing multiple payment options for the streaming service, multiple subscription tiers based on movie quality resolution(Standard 720p60, High Definition 1080p60, UHD), frame rate and allowed number of devices.

Stores are being phased out, sales and stock replenishment associates, cashiers, and store managerial staff will be directly affected by these changes. Store Real Estate will be listed for sale or rent, while maintaining relevant corporate offices

Contracts with movie copy providers will run until expiration date or terminated prematurely, severing business ties given they no longer provide a service to our organization.

Introduction of Digital Movies for streaming will require an **IT** and **Customer Service** divisions, physical servers to host the movie streaming service platform provided to the subscribed customers or a third party Cloud Computing provider. 

A team of customer service representatives will be placed at an office in company headquarters to aid subscribed customers with any technical issues they may encounter while streaming movies from any of our apps and platforms.

A software developer team will be hired to create and monitor the device-specific applications to stream movies from different devices, which include Web Browsers, iOS iPhones, Android handhelds, Windows PC, MAC OS and Linux Desktop distros

These changes will affect suppliers, current employees, managerial staff , Head of Departments, Investors, and Corporate accordingly, effective immediately.

`Components excluded from this project`

The decision to leave the physical stores out of the new business model came down to the group's decision (Y-3, N-1, ?-1) due to lack of time. Adding stores to the model entails the introduction of multiple entities and complexities such as
━ Orders and their Details, Multi-Payment transactions that differ from the subscription based model
━ a more robust Human Resources schema to keep track of employees, their responsibilities and the possibility of multiple positions with different salaries
━ a schema that provides multi-dimensional mobility to product inventory by tracking availability within a wide range of scopes: local, regional, national, ...
━ depth to a Product by classification into parent categories and possible sub-categories
━ movie franchise identification for the purpose of enabling multi-product grouping and facilitating the front-end developers in charge of the website's product sales and merchandising.
━ a comprehensive focus on the 'Movie' as they are at the core of organization's business model
━ Multi-Streaming Service Hub to include other streaming services a customer may have into our Streaming Hub to facilitate and enhance the movie/show watching experience
━ Physical movie blue-rays and DVDs on physical stores
━ Rental Records as they no longer serve the model
