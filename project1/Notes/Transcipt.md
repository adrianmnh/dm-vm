the erwin emovies data model is the starting building block tom this project

The purpose was to recreate this model or to improve it in a way that it can be sued in todays world

This model features physical rental videos, which isnt seen around these days, so its outdated


For this project, I recreated the model and added some features of my own,

by converting it into a movie streaming online platform, with a business focus on movie merchandising

by allowing customers to watch movies through an online movie portal, or purchase physical copies of the films 

at a store closest to them, as well as movie related merchandise and memoribilia.
 

I accomplished all this using ErWin Data Modeler to create the 3 different data models, MS Word to create documents, 

Excel to create spreadsheets that I used to import and export data into the model's Bulk Editor,

github for version control, making my project portable

OBS record my screen and Movie editor to collect all video snippets together
